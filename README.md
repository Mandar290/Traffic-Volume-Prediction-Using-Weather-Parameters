# Vision-Language Modeling for Visual Question Answering (VQA)

## Description
This project implements an simple Vision-Language Model designed for Visual Question Answering (VQA), a task that requires the model to answer questions about the content of images. By combining state-of-the-art techniques from computer vision and natural language processing, the model effectively bridges the gap between visual data and textual information.

The VQA system uses pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet for visual feature extraction, enabling the model to capture intricate details from images. For the textual component, transformer-based models like BERT are utilized to understand and process the question posed.

To effectively merge the visual and textual information, this project explores various fusion techniques such as:

Concatenation: Combining the visual features from the CNN and textual embeddings from the transformer model directly.
Attention Mechanisms: Using attention layers to dynamically weigh the importance of visual features based on the question.
Multimodal Transformers: Leveraging transformer architectures that are specifically designed to handle both image and text inputs simultaneously, enabling richer interactions between modalities.
By integrating these models and techniques, the VQA system can accurately interpret images, understand complex questions, and provide precise answers. This project not only demonstrates the power of combining vision and language models but also serves as a robust framework for developing interactive AI applications in fields like education, healthcare, and customer service.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Identify objects and scenes within images.
- **Question Understanding**: Parse and understand natural language questions.
- **Answer Generation**: Provide accurate answers based on the visual content of the image.
- **Pre-trained Model Support**: Use and fine-tune pre-trained models for enhanced performance.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable to other vision-language tasks.
