# Vision-Language Modeling for Visual Question Answering (VQA)

## Description
This project implements a Vision-Language Model for Visual Question Answering (VQA). The system can understand and answer questions about images by leveraging both visual and textual data. It integrates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing to perform tasks such as identifying objects in images and comprehending the context of questions.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Identify objects and scenes within images.
- **Question Understanding**: Parse and understand natural language questions.
- **Answer Generation**: Provide accurate answers based on the visual content of the image.
- **Pre-trained Model Support**: Use and fine-tune pre-trained models for enhanced performance.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable to other vision-language tasks.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-language-modeling-vqa.git
    cd vision-language-modeling-vqa
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download and set up the dataset**:
    - Follow the instructions in the `Dataset` section below to download the necessary datasets.

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
This command will start training using the specified configuration file.

Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model's performance, run:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model-checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.pth
Inference
To perform inference on a new image-question pair, use:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --image path/to/image.jpg --question "What is in the image?"
Dataset
This project uses the VQA v2.0 dataset. Follow these steps to set up the dataset:

Download the images and questions from the VQA v2.0 download page.
Extract the images and place them in the data/images directory.
Extract the questions and place them in the data/questions directory.
Models
This project leverages pre-trained models to enhance accuracy. Some of the models used include:

Visual Encoder: Pre-trained ResNet or EfficientNet models for image feature extraction.
Text Encoder: BERT or GPT-based models for question understanding.
Multimodal Fusion: Custom layers to integrate visual and textual features.
You can download pre-trained model weights from the links provided in the models/ directory.

**Results**
Here are some sample results showcasing the capabilities of our VQA system:

Image	Question	Answer
What is the man holding?	A tennis racket
What color is the cat?	Black
